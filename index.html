      <h1>PRODUCT OF THE WEEK</h1>
      <p>Native to South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, the <strong>String of Hearts</strong> (ceropegia woodii) is a beautiful addition
         to any home. The heart-shaped leaves come in a variety of colors that can change with differentiating care. The plant
         can grow to hang an average of three to nine feet long.</p>

      <h2>PLANT CARE</h2>
      <p>For greener leaves, keep the soil moist and leave in direct sunlight for about 6 hours a day.
         For pink-toned leaves, water less frequently and expose the plant to more sunlight. Water
         just enough to wet the top of the soil.</p>
